# Python Challenge
## Module 3 Python Challenge for University of Birmingham Data Analytics Bootcamp
### Description
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### PyBank Challenge
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Created a Python script to analyze the financial records of a company using a financial dataset called budget.csv. The dataset is composed of two columns: "Date" and "Profit/Losses".

The code analyzes the records to calculate each of the following values:
- The total number of months included in the dataset
- The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
- The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes
- The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
- The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

The final script prints the analysis to the terminal and exports a text file with the results.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### PyPoll Challenge
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Created a script to help a small, rural town modernize its vote-counting process using a set of poll data called election_data.csv. The dataset is composed of three columns: "Voter ID", "County", and "Candidate". 

The code analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following values:
- The total number of votes cast
- A complete list of candidates who received votes
- The percentage of votes each candidate won
- The total number of votes each candidate won
- The winner of the election based on popular vote

The final script prints the analysis to the terminal and exports a text file with the results.
